The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 and to boost adjusted per-share earnings by one cent.", "assetTags": ["Boston Scientific", "BSX NYSE", "BSX US"], "searchTags": ["BSX"], "category": "major_publication", "url": "https://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/marketpulse/~3/Qv4mPNr8Fa8/story.aspx?utm_campaign=cityfalcon&utm_medium=cityfalcon&utm_source=cityfalcon", "imageUrls": null, "lang": "en", "cityfalconScore": 47, "additionalData": {}, "source": {"name": "marketwatch.com", "brandName": "MarketWatch", "imageUrl": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/small.png", "imageUrls": {"thumb": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/thumb.png", "small": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/small.png", "medium": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/medium.png", "large": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/large.png"}}, "duplicatesCount": 0, "paywall": false, "registrationRequired": false, "cityfalcon_permalink": "https://www.cityfalcon.com"}]
