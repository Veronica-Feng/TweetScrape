Formerly home mainly to meatpacking plants, the district has in recent decades been largely overtaken by destination restaurants, boutique hotels, residential conversions and in-fill developments, and most recently corporate flagship office locations, such as those of McDonald's and Google . The brewery and beerhall would likely utilize a disused Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal structure, Crain's reported. According to a Guinness fact sheet, the brewer operates five breweries in five countries around the world while Guinness \"is brewed in 49 countries around the world,\" including licensed locations. A Baltimore brewery that opened in 2017 makes Guinness beers other than the trademark Guinness Extra Stout.
