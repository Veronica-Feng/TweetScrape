Inc. were down 0.1% in premarket trading on Friday, the day after the Food and Drug Administration said it plans to convene an advisory committee on Nov. 30 to discuss the company's experimental COVID-19 pill, molnupiravir. Merck is developing the antiviral with the privately held Ridgeback Biotherapeutics; it recently applied for emergency authorization. The FDA requested advisory committee meetings for each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines but it did not convene one ahead of the authorizations of the monoclonal antibodies or Gilead Sciences Inc.'s remdesivir, an antiviral used to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients that is now fully approved. \"We believe that, in this instance, a public discussion of these data with the agency's advisory committee will help ensure clear understanding of the scientific data and information that the FDA is evaluating to make a decision about whether to authorize this treatment for emergency use,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.", "assetTags": ["Gilead Sciences", "GILD NASDAQ", "GILD US"], "searchTags": ["GILD"], "category": "major_publication", "url": "https://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/marketpulse/~3/YMYnScGQfw0/story.aspx?utm_campaign=cityfalcon&utm_medium=cityfalcon&utm_source=cityfalcon", "imageUrls": null, "lang": "en", "cityfalconScore": 47, "additionalData": {}, "source": {"name": "marketwatch.com", "brandName": "MarketWatch", "imageUrl": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/small.png", "imageUrls": {"thumb": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/thumb.png", "small": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/small.png", "medium": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/medium.png", "large": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/large.png"}}, "duplicatesCount": 0, "paywall": false, "registrationRequired": false, "cityfalcon_permalink": "https://www.cityfalcon.com/news/directory/stocks/gilead-sciences-gild"}]
