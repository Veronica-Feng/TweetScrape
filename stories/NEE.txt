The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF dropped 1.4% in afternoon trading with 25 of 28 equities components losing ground. The decline was enough to pace all of the SPDR ETFs tracking the S&P 500's 11 key sectors in declines. Within the XLU, the biggest loser was NextEra Energy Inc.'s stock , which fell 3.0%. Among other more active components, shares of Exelon Corp. shed 1.7%, CenterPoint Energy Inc. slipped less than 0.1% and PPL Corp. gave up 0.7%, while Consolidated Edison Inc. was the best performer with a 1.0% gain. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was on track to close at the highest yield since June 3, and Treasury prices fell, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will cut its monthly Treasury purchases. Utilities stocks tend to be stable and have relatively high dividend yields, so they often trade as bond proxies, and fall when Treasury prices fall and Treasury yields rise.", "assetTags": ["NextEra Energy Inc", "NEE NYSE", "NEE US"], "searchTags": ["NEE"], "category": "major_publication", "url": "https://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/marketpulse/~3/YDwFaixxJrQ/story.aspx?utm_campaign=cityfalcon&utm_medium=cityfalcon&utm_source=cityfalcon", "imageUrls": null, "lang": "en", "cityfalconScore": 47, "additionalData": {}, "source": {"name": "marketwatch.com", "brandName": "MarketWatch", "imageUrl": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/small.png", "imageUrls": {"thumb": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/thumb.png", "small": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/small.png", "medium": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/medium.png", "large": "https://cityfalconproduction.blob.core.windows.net/autotweetmedia/domains/logos/3682/large.png"}}, "duplicatesCount": 3, "paywall": false, "registrationRequired": false, "cityfalcon_permalink": "https://www.cityfalcon.com"}, {"uuid": "a6b9c31e-4e0d-4fb4-a9f1-a80c23b7ab52", "publishTime": "2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z", "title": "Is NextEra Energy The Best Electric Utility Stock To Buy Now?", "description": "We think that OGE Energy - a company that provides electric utility services in Oklahoma and western Arkansas and owns midstream assets - is a better pick compared to NextEra Energy- the largest utility holding company by market cap.
