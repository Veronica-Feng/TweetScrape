""On the liability front, one could argue visibility is worse now than before, and the company's decision to report expenses in the segments, as opposed to breaking them out in corporate, is difficult to understand, while recent ear-plug suits are negative new news,"" Tusa wrote in a note to clients. "" On the businesses, after a short bump on growth off of a bottom, the company is again missing big on margins on only a slight decline in sales and our historical concerns around an impaired business model here remain - economic recovery has not cured this problem, and companies that continually deliver big misses on only minor fundamental bumps are lower quality and deserve a discount.""

Greg Abbott issued an executive order Monday to prohibit any entity, including private business, from enforcing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on workers and called on state lawmakers to pass a similar ban into law, the Associated Press reported. The move comes as the administration of President Joe Biden gears up to issue rules requiring employers with more than 100 workers to be vaccinated or test weekly for the coronavirus.

The facility will rank among North America's largest plastic waste recycling facilities, with capacity of 30,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year. ExxonMobil Chemical Co. president Karen McKee said the company is scaling up recycling after it set up a smaller, temporary facility that's producing commercial volumes of polymers. The oil giant plans to build about 500,000 metric tons of advanced recycling capacity globally over the next five years including a site in Notre Dame de Gravenchon, France, plus it's assessing sites in the Netherlands, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, and Singapore. It's also set up a joint venture with Agilyx Corp. and Cyclyx International LLC to boost its recycling efforts.

Its selling point is that its loans are cheaper and more responsible alternatives to credit cards, the newspaper reported. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told the WSJ the deal will help the bank's push into Main Street lending and to ""build a real banking platform of the future."" The price amounts to a 55% premium to GreenSky's Tuesday closing price and includes a $445 million tax adjustment.

The company said late Tuesday that it raised its quarterly dividend to 62 cents a share from 56 cents, with the new dividend payable Dec. 9 to shareholders of record on Nov. 18.

The decline was enough to pace all of the SPDR ETFs tracking the S&P 500's 11 key sectors in declines. Within the XLU, the biggest loser was NextEra Energy Inc.'s stock , which fell 3.0%. Among other more active components, shares of Exelon Corp. shed 1.7%, CenterPoint Energy Inc. slipped less than 0.1% and PPL Corp. gave up 0.7%, while Consolidated Edison Inc. was the best performer with a 1.0% gain. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was on track to close at the highest yield since June 3, and Treasury prices fell, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will cut its monthly Treasury purchases.

The SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF dropped 1.4% in afternoon trading with 25 of 28 equities components losing ground. The decline was enough to pace all of the SPDR ETFs tracking the S&P 500's 11 key sectors in declines. Within the XLU, the biggest loser was NextEra Energy Inc.'s stock , which fell 3.0%. Among other more active components, shares of Exelon Corp. shed 1.7%, CenterPoint Energy Inc. slipped less than 0.1% and PPL Corp. gave up 0.7%, while Consolidated Edison Inc. was the best performer with a 1.0% gain. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was on track to close at the highest yield since June 3, and Treasury prices fell, as investors bet the Federal Reserve will cut its monthly Treasury purchases. Utilities stocks tend to be stable and have relatively high dividend yields, so they often trade as bond proxies, and fall when Treasury prices fall and Treasury yields rise.",PPL Corp-PPL LSE-PPL GB-PPL NYSE-PPL US,PPL

GM has had a ""black cloud"" over its stock after its Chevy Bolt recall and the impact from the chip shortage, but longer term, ""we continue to believe the broader story and investment thesis at GM is around its massive EV ambitions over the next decade,"" Ives said. Wall Street has been skeptical that GM can be successful in the world of electric vehicles in the face of competition from Tesla and others. But the auto maker plans to spend $35 billion in research and development on electric vehicles and aims to convert 20% of its installed base to EVs by 2026. ""GM is putting their money where their mouth is and are going all-in on the electric vehicle arms race playing out across the auto industry,"" he said.
